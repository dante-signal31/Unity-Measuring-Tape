## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you spot a vulnerability, [search if an issue already exists](https://docs.github.com/en/github/searching-for-information-on-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests#search-by-the-title-body-or-comments) alerting of that same vulnerability. 
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant [issue form](https://github.com/dante-signal31/rpmsign/issues/new/choose).

I'll try to fix the vulnerability as soon I can. If you feel confident to try to fix it by yourself, feel free to propose my a [Pull Request](CONTRIBUTING.md)
